On Wednesday, October 7, 2020, Jennifer Dounda and Emmanuelle Charpentier were jointly awarded the Noble Prize in Chemistry for their efforts working on a gene editing method called Crispr-Cas9. This award also celebrates the two as the 6th and 7th women in history to win a prize in chemistry.

Their work together started in 2012 with a co-authored paper demonstrating the power of Crispr-Cas9. Since then, the technology surrounding this gene-editing method has led to its use testing cures for genetic disorders like hereditary blindness and sickle cell disease. It has also been used in genetic modification of crops to create new plants, as well as in research to bring extinct species back to life. A controversial development in science, Crispr has become a genetic tool with the potential to introduce limitless possibilities to science as we know it.
