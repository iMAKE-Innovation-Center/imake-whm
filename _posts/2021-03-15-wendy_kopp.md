After graduating she attended Princeton University as a public policy major. At Princeton is
where Wendy had more interactions with students with different diverse backgrounds. This is
where she became aware of how many of the students that were from disadvantaged
communities came into university unprepared.

This is where Wendy‘s passion came to help improve America‘s system of education
especially in lower income areas. Wendy’s senior thesis at Princeton university was a proposal
for a national service organization. Her thesis stated that recruit graduates of the nations top
universities to teach in underserved areas. Her psychology professor Bresaler was very
impressed by her thesis proposal. He never believed that she would get enough funds to actually
create it. That is when she decided to take a chance and send her thesis “ A plan in argument for
the creation of the national teacher corps” to a business leader who said he was interested in
trying to improve the education system. In her senior year she met with the nation's largest
corporations to discuss her proposal. In 1989 is when Kopp graduated and received her degree
from Princeton. That summer is where she spent visiting school systems, recruiting boardmembers, and donors to create Teach for America. At first Teach for America started with four
staff members. By 1990 they had more than 4,000 corporation members.

The Teach for America organization has received attention nationally. It was growing
rapidly and expanded all throughout the United States. Teach for All has reached more than
10,000 court members. It has helped more than 750,000 students. Wendy has received numerous
